  ## Description:
  Application built to further my understanding of connecting service workers, cache and manifests to PWAs. The concepts covered assist with users running applications while not being connected to a live network but being able to pull data offline and post. Within this application, a user is able to post and keep track of their expenses regardless of whether or not they are online. Having an application that can handle user input regardless of network connection is a useful tool while making applications for a wide range of users.
